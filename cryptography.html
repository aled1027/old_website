          <p>
            Oblivious RAM (Random Access Memory) algorithms, otherwise known as ORAM algorithms, are cryptographyic algorithms designed to obscure a client's access patterns to a server.
            Even if the client encrypts their data before sending it to the server, it turns that the manner in which the client accesses the data reveals a whole bunch of information about the data itself. 
            Therefore it is imperative that in a world of "cloud servers" that we ensure that the server cannot learn any information from the access patterns. 
            This is achieved by making the client's sequence of access patterns appear as if the client is accessing random parts of the data.
            </br>
            </br>

            Cryptographers have developed several good, efficient ORAM algorithms to data, but the algorithms have yet to be used in practice.
            My research extended existing ORAM algorithms to be more suitable for practical applications by making them "externally verifiable". 
            Externally verifiable means that a trusted third party can verify that the client and server are cooperating in their exchange of data.
            ORAM protocols, by their nature, require a more complex interchange of messages and data between the client and server. 
            My work ensures that both parties are exchanging messages approprately, and prevents either side from cheating. 
            As a result of our research, ORAM protocols can now ensure proper behavior via escrow - that is, each side is guaranteed to face a monetary penalty if they attempt to cheat.
