            While I can't reveal the details yet, we are working on a method for improving the efficiency of Yao's garbled circuit.
            I constructed a proof-of-concept, writing the code in C and building off of BHR's JustGarble.
            Our preliminary results suggest that we are achieving increased speeds, lower bandwidth and less computation.

          <p>
            Oblivious RAM (Random Access Memory) algorithms, or ORAM algorithms, are cryptographyic algorithms designed to obscure a client's access patterns to a server.
            Consider when a client has their files saved on dropbox or an email repository.
            When a client accesses their files on the server, they access particular files in a particular sequence.
            It turns out that the files accessed and the sequence of their access reveals a lot of information about what the client is doing, even if the files are encrypted.
            </br>
            </br>
            Our research was on extending exisiting ORAM algorithms to be <i>externally verifiable</i>.
            An externally verifiable ORAM algorithm allows for a third party - say a trusted friend or well paid contractor - to oversee ORAM operations and identify if a party attempts to violate protocol.
            This makes ORAM algorithms significantly more useful, as clients and servers can now use them with confidence that they will not be undermined or cheated.
