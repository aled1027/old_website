            Climate Change
          </h2>
          <p>
            My interest in Climate Change lies in a few areas. 
            </br></br>
            First, I am interested in simply learning more from a lot of people. One thing that makes climate change an interesting issue is that it's so interdisciplinary, and there is so much happening. While at Reed, I cofounded the <i>Climate Change Discussion Group</i>, a group of students and faculty that meets weekly to discuss a climate change topic.
            </br></br>
            Second, I am interested in using computer science in climate change science to aid researchers. I think there are many areas where research could benefit greatly by adopting ideas from computer science, and from better programming. 
            </br></br>
            Third, I am interested in finding general methods of helping society adapt to a changing climate. No matter what we do, our climate is going to be different in the coming decades, and in order to respond to that change, our society needs to innovate. I am interested in thinking about and developing the innovations we are going to need in a changed climate.
