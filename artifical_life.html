            My work in machine learning is one part self-driven study and one part applied to my Artificial Life research. In my own studies, I have investigated and often implemented a number of machine learning techniques including by not limited to: natural language processing algorithms, support vector machines, hierarchal clustering, decision trees and random forest, various types of neural nets, regression, and network and graph theory algorithms.

            My work in Artificial Life has been with a research team headed by Mark Bedau. Mark has been investigating the US patents database for a number of years to analyze the "evolution of technology". I contribute my math-computer science background to the theory, and implement a number of machine learning, data analysis and bioinformatics techniques to study the database.

            Our research is pretty cool. Building on ideas in biological evolution, we think of each patent as an organism with traits, parents and children. A patent's traits are determined by using machine learing and natural language processing techniques on the abstract of the patent. The parents of a patent are the patents which this patent cites, and the children are all future patents which cite this patent. This construction builds a directed, acyclic graph (DAG) where each node has characteristics - which we encode via the aforementioned methods in a high dimensional vector space. Now that this network is built, we run various algorithms to learn more about its structure.
