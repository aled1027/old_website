              About Me
          </h2>
          <p>
            I am currently a senior Math-Computer Science major at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. I have a number of interests, many of which are detailed on this site, ranging from cryptography to climate change to feminism. I am currently looking for a job after I graduate, in the area of cryptography, machine learning, climate change, or other computer science fields. If you would like to talk about a potential job, please email me. 
            </br>
           </br>
            I often have a number of ongoing projects. If you have an idea or an interesting project, feel free to email me. I would love to talk about the project, bounce ideas, and if things work out, perhaps join in on the project.
            </br>
            </br>
            On that note, I love to learn about other people's ideas and work, and talk to them what I've been thinking about. If you are in the Portland area, I would love to meet up for coffee or a meal and discuss ideas.
            </br>
            </br>
            The best way to get a hold of me is by email: <h4>aled1027 at gmail dot com</h4>
