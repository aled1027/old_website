<h1 id="idea-sex-instutions-and-companies-that-do-good">Idea Sex: Instutions and Companies that do good</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What kind of a institutional structure is ideal for having the &quot;biggest impact on the world?&quot; Is it a for-profit institution or a non-profit institution? What would be the best incentive structure? What's the goal? Everyone has different answers for these questions. Some may answer that a healthy mix of for-profit and not-for-profit institutions would be idea; they each serve a different role in society and it would be wrong to say that either institution has a better impact on society than another - they are simply existing and helping within the system.</p>
<p>I like and I don't like that answer. I like it because it I think it is true. A diverse set of institutions is important, but it also kind of misses the point. The questions, maybe I could have phrased them better in retrospect, are trying to get an the idea of how can a single human be the most productive, give society the most utils possible per hour of effort? Where and how should such a person work?</p></li>
<li><p>I'm interested in the idea of not-for-profits that aim to help with climate change issues. It's seems like any &quot;true&quot; anti-climate change institution should be a not-for-profit. If they were a for-profit company, then they are by necessity of their nature benefitting off of preventing climate change, benefits and efforts that could be alternatively given to the real cause: helping climate change. On the other hand, what would a not-for-profit do? Raise money and then increase awareness? Try to come up with innovations that they then either open source or sell to a for-profit company because otherwise the innovation is not economical and nobody would use it? Since neither a for-profit company nor a not-for-profit institution seems like a good candidate for a job, there may be a problem in our system. Who is going to take care of things? Is it going to be the government stepping in? If they were, I envision something like the manhattan project? or whatever a modern equivalent is.</p></li>
<li><p>One product that I recall receiving press attention a year or two ago was an app developed by some college students for persons walking home at night who felt unsafe. The persons would open up the app, and hold their finger to the screen until they were home. If at any point they remove their finger from the screen for more than 5-10 seconds, then the app would alert authorities or friends that something was wrong with the friend. Brilliant. I haven't heard about this app, but I think the idea could be piggy backed into further things. I wonder what other apps this idea has influenced.</p></li>
<li><p>A company idea that I like is a consulting company for Scientists where the scientists need help with programming, either data analysis or writing algorithms or whatever. Scientists are simply not programmers; it's not what they're trained to do. And as a result much of the code that they write is not reusable, not readable, and has bugs. It would be great if they had a service that could help them out with these kinds of things. I'm not sure how the company would work with NSF funding, acknowledgements, authorship, etc. Besides those things, this seems like a great niche.</p></li>
<li><p>On the note of number 4, It seems like Academia (in my experience) is pretty isolated from the services offered to for-profit companies. For-profit companies, if they need some programming done or data analysis, hire people to do it or outsource it. Either way, they have someone trained for the job complete the task. In academia, this seems to not the be the case as often. I would love to see a more generalized consulting company (generalized out of point 4) that serves a connecting role.</p></li>
<li><p>I wonder to what extent the vibe of a coffee shop affects the effectiveness and efficiency of the work of the patrons? Is there some &quot;better&quot; format for coffee shops that would permit better and more efficient work? I like the idea of a paid library. I pay by the hour to enter the area to work. Inside the area, there are cheaper drinks than a normal coffee shop (maybe free, ignore the details), and there is good internet and resources and groups can work together easily. In essence, it's a commercialization of a library. Perhaps adding resources, whatever resources are these days, would make the area better. Anyway, the clientele would be students, people who want to get out of the office, telecommuters, etc. More or less the same clientele as coffee shops. Back to the original question: is there any sound reason to suggest that such an environment would be more conducive to good work than a traditional coffee shop, or a public/university library?</p></li>
<li><p>I'm really excited for 3-D printers how they can change the business marketplace. Not too much to say, just really cool to think about. You can build whatever shapes you want.</p></li>
<li><p>I wish that normal people (read non-computer science people) knew how to use their computers better. They have icons on their screen that they don't even know how to use or get rid of! Talk about not having control over your own device that you (may) use hours a day. It really reminds me of the main criticism put forward in Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. There is a disconnect between us and technology. We don't have very much power over the technology. We have to use it, to keep with this modern, fast-paced world, but we are uncomfortable with it, clunky in our usage. It would be great if we could get past the superficial aspects of a laptop screen, take minutes and hours to figure out what's going on and change how we use and think about these devices that are integral for our lives.</p>
<p>This relates to the starting companies because I feel that Apple is almost doing a good job at this but could be doing better. I would like to see a good company that emphasizes the &quot;user&quot; having power over the &quot;device&quot;. Instead of an iPhone tracking data that you aren't even aware of, having apps on a phone that you have never opened, what if we truly customized our devices, the same way we customize our clothes and our rooms, and have power over them. This is more of a cultural change than anything, but a well situated company could stack to take advantage of this gap in our relationships with technology.</p></li>
<li><p>When it comes to making companies that help people, you are forced to ask the question: are we actually helping people or are we making people feel better/safer/more productive. There is a distinction between the two, and while some companies can do both, I think it's actually a quite difficult thing to do. Imagine Apple, a company that we probably think makes us more productive with their products. We do work on our laptops, for most of us, almost all of our work happens on here, but to what extent is that just perception? Maybe we would be more productive on our laptops if the aesthetics weren't so slick, then we could get down to work, but as it stands, we just feel like we get work done better, without actually achieving any more productivity. Apple should be aware that they are just making patrons feel more productive without actually making them more productive. The former helps create money; the latter helps people.</p>
<p>I don't actually think that Apple products decrease productivity, I was just trying to give an example. There is definitely a better example, but the point stands about the two intentions of a company - helping verse perception of helping - being distinct intentions. Which is a more noble goal? Which is social preferable? Is it possible that the latter (perception of helping) is actually more helpful? Is it possible that actually increasing productivity with the perception of it is more profitable?</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, to what extent is it a noble pursuit, a worthwhile time, good for society, to go into drug research. I have no idea, but it's a curious question that I have mixed feelings about.</p></li>
