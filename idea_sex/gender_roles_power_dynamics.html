<h1 id="topic-gender-roles-and-power-dynamics">Topic: Gender Roles and Power Dynamics</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>I wonder to what extent people want a culturally defined role to fit. Perhaps life is easier when you take on a position where many of the decisions you make are predetermined by choice of role. Making decisions sucks, so I can definitely imagine that. I guess that what I really wonder is how people deal with fitting into a role. That just seems really hard. Does anybody truly do it?</p></li>
<li><p>I also wonder what kind of business niche there exist that relates to gender roles. Businesses already take advantage of gender in their marketing. Take for a moment the supposition that the people are tending to adhere to culturally constructed roles less strictly. What business opportunities are there then for a clientele who doesn't follow a culturally constructed role?</p></li>
<li><p>If we could do anything, how would we help people who face oppression due gender roles and power dynamics?</p></li>
<li><p>How could gender roles be modeled using cellular automata?</p></li>
<li><p>To what extent are roles and power dynamics informed by local information. In particular, to what extent is my perception of my power in the world formed by the amount of power I have in my family/school and not informed by the amount of power I have in a larger setting?</p></li>
<li><p>Are we looking for gender to become less important?</p></li>
<li><p>Are we looking for gender equality?</p></li>
<li><p>Are we looking for gender equal opportunity? Is this different from generic equality?</p></li>
<li><p>Are we looking for gender fairness?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is gender so goddam important? I never think about it as it relates myself. Why not? Is it because I'm a man? If the personal is the political, then shouldn't my personal &quot;struggles&quot; (or lackthereof) inform my understanding and political stance on gender issues?</p></li>
